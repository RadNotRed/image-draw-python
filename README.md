# image-draw-python
Turning images into mouse movement. Can be used for Cash App card designs! (Like what I used it for)

This program automates drawing by converting an image into mouse movements. You can partner it with **[Phone Link](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NMPJ99VJBWV)** (Windows only) to draw directly on your phone using screen mirroring.
